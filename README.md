# Neural-Network-for-Regression
This task was completed as a group coursework task for the Introduction to Machine Learning course. 

Part 1 involved implementing forward and backward propagation functions for linear, sigmoid and relu layers and then using these to create a MLP. 

Part 2 involved using Pytorch to create and tune a neural network to complete a regression task involving house price predictions. Tuning invloved performing hyperparameter search for the configuration that gave the best performance on a held-out dataset (performance metric used was RMSE).

# Running the code
Use terminal commands to run the two Python files.

To Run the file for Part 1 use:
`python3 part1_nn_lib.py`

To run the file for Part 2 use:
`python3 part2_house_value_regression.py`

# Ackowledgements
Antione Cully, Marek Rei and Josiah Wang for guidance throughout the project

Rishil Patel, Gowoon Kim and Hussain Kurabadwala for contributions to the code for both Part 1 and Part 2 tasks.
